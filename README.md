# README

This node application displays a business card in the terminal, with contact information and clickable links to various online platforms.

To view the business card in your terminal application you can simply run the command:

`npx alekzandriia`

To run the application locally, use the following instructions.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine

## Installation

- Clone the repository or download the source code.
- Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command to install the dependencies:

  `npm install`

## Usage

- In the terminal, navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command to start the application:

  `./bin/index.js `

- The business card will be displayed in the terminal with contact information and clickable links.
- Use cmd/ctrl + click to open the links in a browser.
- Additionally, you can interact with the application by selecting options from the interactive menu.

## Customization

This business card includes information about myself, but it can easily be customized for you to use yourself!

All you need to do is replace the data in the `links` object and the `info` object.

NOTE: I have the same username for all of my online accounts, so changing the `username` variable updates all of the links accordingly. If you use different usernames for different platforms then you'll have to update each link manually.

You will also want to update the package.json with your own `name`, `description` and `bin`.

Publish your customized app to npm if you want to share it with others. ðŸ¤—
